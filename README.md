Dog Breed Classification Project

üê∂ Project Overview

This project is a deep learning-based dog breed classification system built using EfficientNetB3 with TensorFlow/Keras. The model can accurately identify 120 dog breeds from images. The system can be used for educational purposes, pet recognition applications, or AI-powered mobile/web apps.
